Netflix-UI-Clone
🎬 Netflix Landing Page Clone

This is my first web development project — a Netflix landing page clone created using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to practice layout design, background images, and styling buttons/forms to replicate the Netflix India homepage.

🚀 Features

Netflix-style background with movie posters.

Navbar with logo, language dropdown, and sign-in button.

Hero section with title, description, and call-to-action.

Email form with "Get Started" button.

Styled fully using HTML + CSS only (no JavaScript).
